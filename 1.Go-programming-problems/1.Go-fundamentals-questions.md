## ðŸŸ¨ Go Fundamentals

1. What is the difference between value and pointer receivers in Go? When would you use each?

**Answer:**

Value receivers make a copy of the original object, while pointer receivers operate on the original object.

Use **pointer receivers** when:
- You want to **mutate** the original object.
- Your struct is large and copying is inefficient.

Use **value receivers** when:
- You do **not need to mutate** the object.
- The struct is small and copying is cheap.

```go
type Counter struct {
    count int
}

func (c Counter) IncrementByValue() {
    c.count++
}

func (c *Counter) IncrementByPointer() {
    c.count++
}

func main() {
    c := Counter{}
    c.IncrementByValue()
    fmt.Println(c.count) // Output: 0

    c.IncrementByPointer()
    fmt.Println(c.count) // Output: 1
}
```

2. How do slices, maps, and channels behave when passed between functions?

**Answer:**

- **Slices**: Passing a slice passes a copy of the slice header (not underlying array). Mutations affect the original array.
- **Maps and Channels**: Passed by reference-like semantics. Mutations inside a function affect the original.

```go
func mutateSlice(s []int) {
    s[0] = 99
}

func mutateMap(m map[string]int) {
    m["a"] = 42
}

func main() {
    s := []int{1, 2, 3}
    mutateSlice(s)
    fmt.Println(s) // [99 2 3]

    m := map[string]int{"a": 1}
    mutateMap(m)
    fmt.Println(m) // map[a:42]
}
```

3. What is the zero value of common Go types like string, int, bool, and interfaces?

**Answer:**

Go assigns "zero values" to variables if uninitialized:

| Type      | Zero Value |
|-----------|------------|
| int       | 0          |
| float64   | 0.0        |
| string    | ""         |
| bool      | false      |
| pointer   | nil        |
| interface{} | nil     |
| slice/map/channel/function | nil |

```go
var i int
var s string
var m map[string]int
fmt.Println(i, s, m == nil) // 0 "" true
```

4. How do you manage shared state between goroutines safely?

**Answer:**

Shared state between goroutines should be managed using synchronization primitives like `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`, or channels.

```go
type Counter struct {
    mu    sync.Mutex
    count int
}

func (c *Counter) Increment() {
    c.mu.Lock()
    defer c.mu.Unlock()
    c.count++
}
```

5. What are common pitfalls with channel-based concurrency in Go?

**Answer:**

Common pitfalls include:
- Deadlocks when channels block unexpectedly.
- Goroutine leaks by not handling `ctx.Done()`.
- Writing to closed channels causing panics.
- Unbuffered channels used without synchronization.

```go
// Safe channel usage
go func(ctx context.Context) {
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return
        case msg := <-ch:
            process(msg)
        }
    }
}(ctx)
```

6. How do you store and manage a dynamic list of channels or goroutines?

**Answer:**

Use slices of channels or maps to store references.

```go
workers := make([]chan string, 3)
for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
    workers[i] = make(chan string)
    go func(i int, ch chan string) {
        for msg := range ch {
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d got: %s
", i, msg)
        }
    }(i, workers[i])
}
```

7. When using interfaces in Go, how do you ensure correctness with type assertions and type switches?

**Answer:**

Use `type assertions` and `type switches` to work with `interface{}` types safely.

```go
func describe(i interface{}) {
    switch v := i.(type) {
    case string:
        fmt.Println("String:", v)
    case int:
        fmt.Println("Int:", v)
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown type")
    }
}
```

8. How do you structure a Go application with proper modular boundaries?

**Answer:**

Use modular packages like `handler`, `service`, `repository`, and `model`. Follow separation of concerns.

```
/internal
    /order
        handler.go
        service.go
        repository.go
/model
    order.go
```

9. What is the idiomatic way to organize large Go codebases (beyond just controllers/services)?

**Answer:**

Structure by **business domain**, not technical layers.

```
/order
    /domain
    /adapter
    /usecase
    /infra
```
