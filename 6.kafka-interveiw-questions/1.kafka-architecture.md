# üß† Modern Kafka Architecture (KRaft Mode)

Apache Kafka is a high-throughput, distributed event streaming platform. Starting with Kafka 2.8+, a new **KRaft mode** was introduced to eliminate the dependency on ZooKeeper and simplify the deployment architecture.

### ‚úÖ Key Components

| Component                 | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Producer**              | Sends records (messages) to Kafka topics.                                          |
| **Topic**                 | A logical channel to which producers write and consumers read.                     |
| **Partition**             | Subdivision of a topic for parallelism and scalability.                            |
| **Broker**                | A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients.                                |
| **Kafka Controller**      | Elected broker that manages metadata and cluster state (in KRaft).                 |
| **Consumer**              | Subscribes to one or more topics and processes records.                            |
| **Consumer Group**        | Multiple consumers working together for scalability.                               |
| **KRaft Metadata Quorum** | Replaces ZooKeeper, a quorum of brokers that manage metadata using Raft consensus. |
| **Log**                   | Each partition is an append-only log file on disk.                                 |
| **Offset**                | Position of a record within a partition.                                           |

## üß© Kafka KRaft vs. ZooKeeper Mode

| Feature                  | Kafka with ZooKeeper | Kafka KRaft Mode          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Metadata Manager         | ZooKeeper            | Kafka Broker (Controller) |
| Consensus Algorithm      | ZAB (ZooKeeper)      | Raft                      |
| Setup Complexity         | Requires ZooKeeper   | Simpler (No ZK needed)    |
| Production-ready (2024+) | Deprecated           | Recommended               |

## üîÑ Data Flow Summary (in KRaft Mode)

1. **Producer** sends a message to a **topic**.
2. The message is written to a specific **partition** on a **broker**.
3. Each partition has one **leader broker** and zero or more **followers**.
4. Data is stored on disk in append-only **log files**.
5. **Consumers** read data from partitions, tracking offsets.
6. The **Kafka Controller**, elected from brokers, manages metadata and partition leadership.
7. **KRaft quorum** maintains metadata consistency using Raft consensus protocol.

---

## üîê Modern Features & Enhancements

* **Exactly-once semantics (EOS)** via idempotent producers and transactional APIs.
* **Schema Registry** integration for Avro/JSON/Protobuf validation.
* **Kafka Streams** for in-stream processing.
* **Kafka Connect** for integration with external systems (e.g., DBs, S3).
* **Tiered Storage (in preview)** ‚Äì store old data on cheaper storage (e.g., cloud/S3).

## üß™ Try This Locally

You can simulate a local KRaft-based Kafka cluster using:

```bash
docker-compose -f https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/blob/7.5.0-post/cp-all-in-one-kraft/docker-compose.yml up
```
