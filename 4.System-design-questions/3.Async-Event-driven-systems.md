# 📘 Top 20 Interview Questions on Async/Event-Driven System Design
---

## 1. **What is an event-driven architecture? How does it differ from a request-driven or synchronous system?**

**Answer:**
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which decoupled components communicate via events. An event is a significant change in state (e.g., "order created"). Instead of services calling each other directly (synchronously), they emit and consume events asynchronously via a message broker.

| Aspect        | Event-Driven            | Request-Driven            |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Communication | Async (via broker)      | Sync (direct call)        |
| Coupling      | Loosely coupled         | Tightly coupled           |
| Reliability   | High (via retries)      | Low (if downstream fails) |
| Latency       | Lower perceived latency | Higher for chains         |

**Use Case:** Order systems, audit logs, real-time analytics.

---

## 2. **What is the difference between a message, an event, and a command?**

**Answer:**

* **Message:** Generic term for any data sent between components.
* **Event:** Notification that something *has happened*. Immutable. (e.g., "OrderCreated")
* **Command:** Instruction to *do something*. Imperative. (e.g., "CreateOrder")

| Term    | Direction              | Expect Response? | Example        |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Event   | Producer → Subscribers | No               | UserRegistered |
| Command | Sender → Target        | Yes (usually)    | CreateInvoice  |

---

## 3. **What are the main components of an event-driven system?**

**Answer:**

1. **Event Producer** – Emits events (e.g., Order Service)
2. **Event Consumer** – Listens and acts on events
3. **Event Broker** – Routes events (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
4. **Event Schema** – Defines the structure (Avro, Protobuf)
5. **Event Store (Optional)** – Stores historical events

---

## 4. **Explain at-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once delivery semantics.**

**Answer:**

| Semantic      | Description                         | Risk               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| At-Most-Once  | Delivered max once, no retries      | Message loss       |
| At-Least-Once | Retries till ack                    | Duplicates         |
| Exactly-Once  | Processed once, no loss/duplication | Expensive, complex |

**Kafka Example:** Use Kafka transactions with idempotent consumers and offsets committed only after success.

---

## 5. **What is eventual consistency? How does it apply in async systems?**

**Answer:**
In async systems, services don’t update data at the same time. Instead, updates are propagated via events, and each service updates its state eventually. This leads to eventual consistency — a temporary state of inconsistency that resolves over time.

**Example:** Inventory is updated via "OrderPlaced" events instead of during the transaction.

---

## 6. **What are idempotent consumers? Why are they important?**

**Answer:**
Idempotent consumers produce the same result even if the same event is processed multiple times. This is crucial in at-least-once delivery to avoid duplication or inconsistent state.

**Example:**

```go
if event.ID not in processedIDs {
  process(event)
  markProcessed(event.ID)
}
```

---

## 7. **Design an order processing system using event-driven architecture.**

**Answer:**

**Flow:**

1. OrderService emits `OrderCreated`
2. InventoryService consumes `OrderCreated`, checks stock
3. PaymentService consumes `OrderCreated`, charges user
4. NotificationService sends email on `OrderConfirmed`

**Benefits:**

* Services are decoupled
* Scalable independently
* Supports retries/failures

---

## 8. **How to handle out-of-order events in audit logs?**

**Answer:**

* Use **event timestamps** and sort before persisting.
* Assign **version numbers** or sequence IDs.
* Apply **event sourcing**: Reconstruct state from events.

---

## 9. **What is a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)?**

**Answer:**
A DLQ stores messages that cannot be processed after N retries. Useful for debugging or alerting.

**Kafka Example:**
Set `max.poll.records`, if a message fails after 3 retries, send to `topic-DLQ`.

---

## 10. **How do you implement correlation IDs for tracing?**

**Answer:**

* Generate a unique UUID per request/event
* Add it to message headers
* Log the ID in each microservice

**Example in Go:**

```go
ctx = context.WithValue(ctx, "correlation_id", uuid.New())
```

Use tools like **OpenTelemetry** to trace the full request chain.

---

## 11. **Pros and cons: Kafka vs HTTP/gRPC**

| Feature       | Kafka (Async)           | HTTP/gRPC (Sync)       |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Latency       | Lower perceived         | Higher                 |
| Reliability   | High (retries, DLQ)     | Fragile (caller waits) |
| Coupling      | Loose                   | Tight                  |
| Observability | Requires correlation ID | Built-in               |

**Verdict:** Use Kafka for workflows, HTTP/gRPC for request/response.

---

## 12. **Design a real-time notification system using events**

**Answer:**

* Users opt-in → stored in Notification DB
* Event: `UserMentioned` → emitted
* NotificationService consumes and sends push/email
* Stores status (SENT, FAILED)

**Idempotency Tip:** Store notification ID and status before sending.

---

## 13. **What are common pitfalls of async systems?**

**Answer:**

* Duplicate processing
* Order of events
* Lost messages
* Difficult debugging/tracing
* Event schema evolution issues

**Mitigations:**

* Idempotent handlers
* Replay capability
* Schema registry
* Correlation IDs

---

## 14. **How to test async systems end-to-end?**

**Answer:**

* Use **contract tests** for producers/consumers
* Use **embedded Kafka/RabbitMQ** in integration tests
* Use **event simulation** tools to inject test messages

```go
// Test consumer by injecting a test event into Kafka topic
```

---

## 15. **How do you monitor async systems?**

**Answer:**

* Use **Prometheus/Grafana** to monitor lag, error counts
* Use **Jaeger/OpenTelemetry** for tracing
* Setup **alerts on DLQs, retry rates, consumer lag**

---

## 16. **What is backpressure in messaging systems?**

**Answer:**
Backpressure happens when consumers are slower than producers. It can:

* Overflow buffers
* Cause memory issues
* Delay processing

**Solution:**

* Use bounded queues
* Apply rate limiting
* Monitor lag metrics

---

## 17. **What is the role of schema registries?**

**Answer:**
Helps validate and evolve message schemas in a versioned manner.

**Tools:** Confluent Schema Registry (Avro), Apicurio (OpenAPI), Buf (Protobuf)

**Benefits:**

* Avoids breaking consumers
* Validates messages before producing/consuming

---

## 18. **How does Kafka ensure exactly-once processing?**

**Answer:**

* Enable **idempotent producers**
* Use **Kafka transactions**
* Commit offsets only **after** successful processing

```go
producer.BeginTransaction()
producer.Send(msg)
producer.CommitTransaction()
```

---

## 19. **How to implement retry logic in async services?**

**Answer:**

* Retry in memory (with exponential backoff)
* Retry via message requeue
* Use DLQs after max attempts

**Example Retry Header:**

```json
{
  "retries": 3,
  "retry_delay_ms": 1000
}
```

---

## 20. **What is the Outbox pattern?**

**Answer:**
Outbox stores events in the same database as the business data within a transaction. A background process reads the outbox and publishes to the message broker.

**Benefits:**

* Prevents race condition between DB commit and event publish
* Ensures consistency

```go
Tx {
   INSERT INTO orders ...
   INSERT INTO outbox_events ...
}
```

## 21. **How would you correlate events across multiple services in a pub-sub system?**

**Answer:**
Use a shared **correlation ID** or **trace ID** generated at the entry point (e.g., HTTP request, UI action). This ID is then propagated as metadata/header in every message across services.

**Tools:** OpenTelemetry, AWS X-Ray, Zipkin.

```json
{
  "correlation_id": "uuid-12345",
  "event": "OrderPlaced"
}
```

Consumers log and trace based on this ID.

---

## 22. **How would you implement end-to-end tracing in an async architecture?**

**Answer:**

1. Generate a **trace context** at entry (span ID, trace ID).
2. Propagate via event headers.
3. Each service logs with that context.
4. Use **distributed tracing tools** (e.g., OpenTelemetry + Jaeger).

```go
ctx := context.WithValue(ctx, "trace_id", uuid.New())
```

Correlate across logs using the same trace ID.

---

## 23. **How would you test a system where components communicate asynchronously?**

**Answer:**

* **Unit Test:** Test event handlers in isolation with mocks.
* **Integration Test:** Run producer + consumer with embedded Kafka/RabbitMQ.
* **Contract Testing:** Verify event schema compatibility.
* **E2E Test:** Simulate full event lifecycle using synthetic events.

Use tools like `testcontainers`, `docker-compose`, or in-memory brokers.

---

## 24. **What mechanisms would you use to prevent or detect message loss in Kafka/RMQ systems?**

**Answer:**

* Enable **acknowledgements** (acks=all in Kafka).
* Enable **replication and durability** (Kafka min.insync.replicas).
* Use **monitoring tools** to track offsets, lag, and throughput.
* Maintain **offset commits** after successful processing only.
* Implement **dead letter queues (DLQ)** for recovery.

---

## 25. **How do you gracefully shut down a long-running goroutine listening to events?**

**Answer:**
Use `context.Context` with cancellation signal and `select` block inside the goroutine.

```go
func listen(ctx context.Context, ch <-chan Event) {
  for {
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
      log.Println("Shutting down listener")
      return
    case evt := <-ch:
      handle(evt)
    }
  }
}
```

Also handle Kafka/RMQ consumer `Close()` method if applicable.

---

## 26. **What retry mechanisms and patterns are suitable for event consumers?**

**Answer:**

* **In-memory retry with backoff:** Retry in loop with increasing delay.
* **Message requeue:** Push back to topic/queue.
* **Retry topics:** Kafka allows retrying to `topic-retry` before DLQ.
* **Idempotency:** Always ensure retries don’t cause side-effects.
* **Circuit breaker:** Temporarily stop retries on system overload.
