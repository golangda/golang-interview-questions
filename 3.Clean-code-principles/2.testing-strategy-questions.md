## ðŸŸ¨ Testing Strategy

1. What is the testing pyramid? How do you apply it in Go-based microservices?
2. What kinds of tests would you prioritize if you had limited time before a release?
3. How would you test a function that produces Kafka events and another that consumes them?
4. How do you mock dependencies (DB, Kafka, external APIs) in Go tests?
5. What tools or techniques do you use for writing integration vs unit vs E2E tests?
6. How do you ensure flaky tests in async systems are handled properly?
7. Whatâ€™s your approach to testing time-sensitive logic (e.g., retries, timeouts)?
